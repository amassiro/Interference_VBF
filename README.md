Interference VBF
================

Interference between WW+2jets and VBF HWW repository.

List of S and S+I distributions for different Higgs masses in a common format:
   * TGraph named "S" and "SI"
   * x = mass(WW)
   * y = S
   * y = S+I

   * several folders, one for each Higgs mass

Comparison of different final states:

   * WW > lvlv (sf and df)
   * WW > lvjj
   * WW (without W decays)
